What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The difference between clone and fork. And I did not understand why we have to use Git and Github. now I understand.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
ALL the concepts in Github were very complicated for me and now I am able to work with someone very clearly on GitHub.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
How to fork and how using a pull request.

What still confuses you about Git?
Maybe I don't know how using git and github like a pro but I don't have big troubles anymore.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Very good !!! I was very nervous about driving but my guide and the viewer were very cool with me.
