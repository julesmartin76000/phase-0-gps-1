What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
It has been confusing understanding fetching a partner's work and sharing my work with them.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The GPS made it easier to push branches and merge them.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I didn't understand cloning vs forking of repositiories.

What still confuses you about Git?
It still confuses me how to get work but I believe git fetch does it.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
This is my second phase 0 so I have done this before but it was a fun experience all the same.
